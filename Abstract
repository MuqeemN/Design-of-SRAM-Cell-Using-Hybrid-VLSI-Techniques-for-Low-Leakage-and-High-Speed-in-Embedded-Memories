A novel 10T SRAM architecture is proposed in
this paper which operates in three modes (active, park, standby
or hold). The main objective of the proposed architecture is to
provide better stability and reduced delay in active mode,
reduced leakage current in standby mode and retaining the
logic state in park mode. Simulation results shows that the
proposed SRAM is much better than conventional and other
SRAM cells designed using hybrid techniques.
it is design using Synopsys tool, 28nm technology.
