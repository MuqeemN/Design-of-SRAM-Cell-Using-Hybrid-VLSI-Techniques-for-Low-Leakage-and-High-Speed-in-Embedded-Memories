Proposed SRAM cell was designed by combining
TRIMODE MTCMOS power and ground gated techniques.
The proposed SRAM cell consist of ten transistors in which
four are high Vt transistors and six are low Vt transistors.
High Vt transistors are slow, but have a low subthreshold
leakage current and low Vt transistors are fast, but have a
high subthreshold leakage current. The SRAM cell is
implemented using low Vt transistors to perform fast
operation and sleepy transistors were implemented using
high Vt transistors to have low subthreshold leakage current.
